    <p style="background: rgba(230, 215, 215, 0.993)">The Brunch Spot is the brainchild of two brunch enthusiasts, Ashley and Janis. One day they both found themselves with a weekday off and decided to go out for a bottomless mimosas brunch. To their surprise, the options were very slim. Most bottomless mimosa brunches were only taking place on the weekend. How could this be, they thought!? Hospitality makes up 57% of the workforce in Las Vegas. Most industry workers are required to work weekends, which means a big chunk of Las Vegas locals do not have the opportunity to go out and enjoy brunch. It was at that moment they created the concept of The Brunch Spot. The mission of The Brunch Spot is to serve delicious house-made dishes alongside bottomless options all week long. We can't wait to welcome you. Cheers!</p>
